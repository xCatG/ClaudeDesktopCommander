### IN PROGRESS


### BLOCKED


### COMPLETED


## Knowledge Base
### Implementation
- Python implementation in `/py` directory
- TypeScript implementation in `/ts` directory
- Both expose similar functionality but with language-specific implementations
- Recent changes focus on native MCP support vs previous approach

- Terminal command execution with timeout and background support
- Process management (list, kill)
- Session management for long-running commands
- Full filesystem operations (read/write, directory management)
- Code editing with search/replace functionality
- File search capabilities
- Claude memo functionality for persistent memory

### Configuration
- After setup, restart Claude Desktop app
- Server will be available as 'desktopCommanderPy' in Claude's MCP server list
- Use read_memo, write_memo, and append_memo tools to maintain context

### Environment
- Added documentation for running under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- Added example configuration for claude_desktop_config.json
- Noted limitations around setup script and path handling for WSL
- Future improvement ideas: more generic path handling, setup script enhancements for WSL

## Change Log
### 2025-03-30
- Implemented enhanced project tools for improved agent context awareness
- Added `explore_project` function to analyze project structure and generate overview
- Enhanced `use_project` to automatically suggest project exploration
- Added `index_file` function for tracking file changes and categorizing project components
- Created comprehensive memo template with self-documentation
- Improved `create_project_memo` with template integration
### 2025-03-30
- Fixed project discovery functionality in Python implementation
- Changed default search path from current directory to `/home/yenchi/src`
- Enhanced directory scanning to look one level deeper for projects
- Updated both `discover_projects` and `search_for_project` functions
- Improved error handling to skip inaccessible directories
- Modified docstrings to reflect the new default behavior
### 2025-03-30
- Enhanced project discovery to use configurable project base path
- Added support for reading `project_default_path` from config.json
- Default value for project path is set to "src" (expands to ~/src)
- Added path expansion to support both relative and absolute paths
- Made code more portable by using home directory detection with os.path.expanduser
- This change makes it easier to configure without hardcoded paths
### 2025-03-29
- Added documentation for running under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- Added example configuration for claude_desktop_config.json
- Noted limitations around setup script and path handling for WSL
- Future improvement ideas: more generic path handling, setup script enhancements for WSL
### 2025-03-30
- Successfully verified memo tools on March 29, 2025
- All three functions (read, write, append) are working properly
- This entry was added using the append_memo tool
### 2025-03-30
- Implemented native MCP protocol support using Anthropic SDK
- Refactored setup script to use non-async implementation
- Updated configuration to use new MCP server structure
- Added dedicated MCP implementation files
- Added Claude memo tools for cross-conversation memory

### 2025-03-30
- Implemented structured memo system with section-based updates, todo management, and change log tracking
- Reorganized memo content for better information discovery
- Added specialized tools for managing TODOs and change logs
- Created memo transformation script to convert legacy format to structured format
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing memo tools

## Implementation Plans

### ✅ Auto-Memo Reading Plan (COMPLETED)
1. **Objective**: Automatically suggest reading project memo when switching to a project
2. **Steps**:
   - Modify `use_project` function to check for memo existence
   - Add prompt in response if memo exists: "Project memo found, reading context..."
   - Add prompt if no memo: "No project memo found. Would you like to explore and create one?"
   - Create helper function to determine if a project is new to this agent
3. **Testing**:
   - Test with existing project that has memo
   - Test with project without memo
   - Verify appropriate prompts are shown
4. **Completion Criteria**:
   - Agent automatically reads memo on project switch
   - Agent offers exploration for new projects

### ✅ Project Exploration and Indexing Plan (COMPLETED)
1. **Objective**: Create initial project understanding when none exists
2. **Steps**:
   - Create `explore_project` function that identifies key files
   - Analyze project structure (directories, file types)
   - Identify common patterns (frameworks, languages)
   - Generate high-level summary of project purpose and structure
   - Create initial memo with findings
3. **Testing**:
   - Test on various project types (Python, TypeScript, etc.)
   - Verify summary includes key components
   - Ensure memo creation works correctly
4. **Completion Criteria**:
   - Agent can identify project type and structure
   - Initial memo provides useful project overview

### ✅ Memo Format Documentation Plan (COMPLETED)
1. **Objective**: Add self-documentation to memo format
2. **Steps**:
   - Create "Usage Guide" section in the memo template
   - Document available tools and their purposes
   - Provide examples of memo usage patterns
   - Add best practices for memo organization
3. **Testing**:
   - Verify guide is understandable by other agents
   - Test by asking agent to perform tasks using the guide
4. **Completion Criteria**:
   - New agents can understand and use memo effectively
   - Documentation explains all tools and sections

### ✅ File Indexing System Plan (COMPLETED)
1. **Objective**: Track which files have been analyzed/modified
2. **Steps**: 
   - Create "File Index" section in Knowledge Base
   - Add tracking for file path, purpose, and last modification
   - Implement automatic updating when files are changed
   - Add categorization of files by function
3. **Testing**:
   - Verify files are correctly tracked when modified
   - Test categorization on various file types
   - Check search functionality for finding files
4. **Completion Criteria**:
   - All modified files are tracked in index
   - Index provides useful context about file purposes
   - Index helps navigate project structure
